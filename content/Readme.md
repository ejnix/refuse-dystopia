Alchemizing Ideas and Solutions 

  

Addressing the problem

Life in America is weird. We are separated by city grids, we have no forest to call our own, many people don’t know where their food comes from, and once they learn are horrified by what we are consuming. We are motivated to care about unfulfilling things [[positive psychology]] by a consumerist culture, and everything we buy destroys the environment a little. We have a loneliness epidemic, our education system is failing us, and we are constantly assimilated to a cold and unconnected culture as everyone interacts through car windows or keeps their heads down. Where’s the village? Where is the love in the eyes of people we greet walking by? Where is our connection with nature? Why aren’t we living beautifully? Sweet life must be somewhere to be found.

Solution in 3 parts: create places to gather, shift our personal living environments and live communally if we desire, use our growing collective action to change the larger structure of the cities we inhabit

  

If this pathway is pursued with enough fervor in enough cities, we could shift our culture at large. We need places for serendipitous radicalization, living examples in which we can remember that we are evolutionarily villagers, places that feel alive and magical, that give you a feeling that once you experience it you can’t go back, and need to find a way to continue living in alignment with yourself. 

  
  
  
  
  
  

If any of this resonates with you, know that you aren’t alone. There are others in your city who feel the same way. WHERE ARE THEY AT? Why haven’t you met them? You probably don’t have a third space that is aligned in which to encounter these allies.

  

Know that these changes start internally, but we need to learn how to begin. We need to meet healers that can guide our changes.

We want to be living differently, but we don’t know how. Some people have started to learn and experiment. Go learn from them. Where? Make that space. 

  

Creating Places to Gather

Guilded Roots

Giving people a third place to connect, realize that they should be living collectively, then the tools to make that happen.

  

We have all the solutions to save us, we just haven’t implemented them yet. That is your job now. It’s my job too.

  
  

Changing the Larger Structure of Cities

Everything we build and interact with in cities is emotional infrastructure. Even if designers don’t acknowledge this, it is true. Gray buildings, uninspired designs, lack of places for people to sit and gather, these all have effects on our mental health. Greenery woven into the city, creative and playful designs with natural materials, plazas, parks and other communal spaces, these could all be healing us.

[[Restorative Cities]] by Jenny Roe goes into depth about designing cities for our mental health. Our environments could and should be medicinal.

  
  

Psychology of Parks (Not all parks are created equal)

It’s the quality, not the quantity. Humans have an inherent ability to detect the ability of a piece of nature to support biodiversity.

We are gravitated towards places that clearly support biodiversity

No more lawns as parks

- Why that’s important
    

Humans love to feel a sense of mystery while exploring a park, discovering what might be behind a bend, over a hill, or around a crop of trees

- Frederick Law Olmstead
    

We need [[third places]]. A place just to be, to feel connected to nature and each other, no timeline, just existing. A place where you may meet people, or run into existing friends and acquaintances. A place for solitude. Parks can fill all of these roles.

Our existing third places in America tend to be bars, which first of all are centered around alcohol, but more importantly, don’t allow children, alienating parents from their community spaces.

  

Paid Time Off to Contribute to a clean, green city

- Clean up trash
    
- Plant natives
    
- Benefits: feeling a part of your own city. We tend to be so disconnected from our own places, we don’t belong to the city, we just exist in it. Changing this paradigm unlocks something deeper within us, the fact that we belong, and are the caretakers of the land we inhabit.

- equity.

- they want to improve the world around them

- We can give this to our [[community members]] through [[transient apartments]], in which part of their rent goes towards equity in a system of shared properties
